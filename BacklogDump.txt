Epic : Input Handler Logic

    Definition of done : Converting input key presses to CAN Frame/s

Stories:

1) Key presses to input signal logic design

    DOD : Decide which keyboard keys mapping to input signals.
          Decide behaviour for those key presses(long press, short press, multiple press). 

2) Key presses to input signal implementation

    DOD : Implement internal states to encode in CAN frame
          Unit test to check value update for internal states with key presses respectively.

3) Encode input signals to CAN Frame

    DOD : Encode CAN frame with internal states
          Unit test to ckeck CAN frame/s with internal states respectively.


Epic : System setup 
    DOD : Make a demo ready system

1) Make Binaries for Input Generator
    DOD : Input generator taking Input for "a key" from keyboard and should output "a CAN Frame"
          Unit test case to test if we have "a CAN Frame output"

2) Make Binaries for Engine Simulator
    DOD : Engine simulator taking "a CAN Frame" as an input from Input Generator
          Giving "a CAN Frame" as an output
          Unit test to have "a CAN Frame output" (After taking "a CAN Frame" as an input from Input Generator)

3) Demo after build
    DOD : make a cmake file and build the code without errors.
